 Cat vs Non-Cat Image Classification Using a Logistic regression along with Neural Networks 
 
INTRODUCTION 
- Here I have used logistic regression along with neural networks, forward and backward propagation, to build an image recognition system  i.e a cat classifier in this case. 
This cat classifier takes an image as an input and then it predicts whether the image contains a cat or 
not.

LOGISTIC REGRESSION
- Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). 
- Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is used for predictive analysis.


DATASET
- The dataset is saved here:https://github.com/aditimukerjee/Cat-and-Non-cat-for-logistic-regression



CONCLUSION
- The accuracy of the training set is 99.99% and the accuracy of the testing set is 72%. Out of the six images used for prediction, one image was predicted incorrectly since the accuracy is still low and it can be further improved.
